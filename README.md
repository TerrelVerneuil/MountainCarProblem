#Mountain Car Problem
Overview
The Mountain Car problem is a classic reinforcement learning problem where an underpowered car must find a way to reach the top of a steep hill. The car is situated in a valley and must leverage potential energy by driving up the opposite hill before it can reach the goal on the rightmost hill. This problem exemplifies the challenges of decision-making under uncertainty and learning from interaction with an environment.

Problem Statement
In the Mountain Car problem, the objective is to control an underpowered car to reach the top of a hill. The car's engine is not strong enough to climb the hill directly, even at full throttle. Therefore, the car must learn to leverage gravity by building up enough momentum from the opposite hill. The environment provides a reward signal that encourages the car to reach the goal with as few steps as possible.

Solution Approach
Our solution employs a reinforcement learning technique known as Q-learning, where an agent learns a policy to maximize the total reward over time. The agent learns to take actions (accelerate left, do nothing, accelerate right) based on its current state (position and velocity) to maximize future rewards. The learning process involves updating a Q-table, which estimates the optimal action-value function, representing the expected utility of taking a given action in a given state.

Key Parameters
Alpha (Learning Rate): Determines the rate at which new information overrides old information.
Gamma (Discount Factor): Balances immediate and future rewards.
Epsilon (Exploration Rate): Determines the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.
