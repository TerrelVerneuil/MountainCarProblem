# Mountain Car Problem

## Overview

The Mountain Car problem is a classic reinforcement learning challenge that involves an underpowered car needing to reach the top of a steep hill. The vehicle is located in a valley and must utilize potential energy from the opposite hill to gain enough momentum to reach the goal. This problem exemplifies decision-making under uncertainty and learning through environmental interaction.

## Problem Statement

The goal in the Mountain Car problem is to maneuver an underpowered car to the peak of a hill. Direct ascent is impossible due to the car's limited power, necessitating a strategy that involves leveraging gravity by accumulating momentum from the opposing hill. The environment rewards the agent for reaching the target with the fewest steps possible.

## Solution Approach

Our approach uses Q-learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm where an agent learns a policy to maximize cumulative rewards. The agent decides among three actions (accelerate left, idle, accelerate right) based on its current state (position and velocity), aiming to maximize future rewards. This involves updating a Q-table, which estimates the utility of actions in given states.

### Key Parameters

- **Alpha (Learning Rate):** Controls how new information affects existing knowledge.
- **Gamma (Discount Factor):** Weighs immediate versus future rewards.
- **Epsilon (Exploration Rate):** Balances between exploring new actions and exploiting known ones.
